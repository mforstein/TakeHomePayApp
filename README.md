LinkedIn Article: Visualizing Your Real Net Pay with the Take Home Pay App
 In today's job market, salary alone doesn't tell the whole story. Commute costs, taxes, insurance, and other expenses dramatically affect your take-home pay. That’s why I built the Take Home Pay App — a Streamlit-powered web tool that brings financial transparency to your job search or relocation decision-making.  🔍 What It Does: - Calculates your actual net income after factoring in commuting miles, gas cost, taxes (federal, state, FICA), car payments, and healthcare. - Lets you select which days you commute (e.g., hybrid or remote schedules). - Visualizes cities within a user-defined distance of your chosen address. - Interactive map and bar chart to compare real take-home pay across different cities.  ⚙️ Features: - Add or remove cities to customize your scenario. - Automatically geocodes new cities you enter. - Distance filter slider (3–300 miles), Salary slider ($1–500K), and more. - Fully interactive, with instant updates when you change inputs. - A clean and intuitive UI — built using Streamlit and Folium.  🎯 Why It Matters: This tool empowers job seekers, remote workers, and hybrid employees to make smarter decisions — not just based on gross salary, but on what actually ends up in their bank account after all expenses.  🧠 Built with Python, Pandas, Streamlit, Folium, and Geopy. 📅 Released: June 2025 👨‍💻 Author: Micah Forstein  Stay tuned for a public GitHub release and tutorial on how to build your own financial transparency tools. #DataVisualization #Python #Streamlit #FinancialPlanning #JobSearch #RemoteWork
